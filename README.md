# Landing Page Project

## Description

This Landing Page project is an exercise in DOM manipulation. The starter code provided by Udacity has some HTML and CSS styling, which displays a static version of the Landing Page. The objective was to convert this project from a static page to an interactive one, which required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily building out the app's functionality in the JavaScript file.

## Usage

The Landing Page is a multi-section page with a dynamically built navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. When the user clicks on a navigation item, the item scrolls smoothly to the appropriate section of the page, instead of the performing the default jump action.

## Dependencies

This project does not require any frameworks or libraries to run.
